Application to compute derivatives and integrals and plot the results

## Motivation
A project for the college - UNIVESP (Universidade Virtual do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo)

## Testing the source code
It should be simple with gnome builder which automates the flatpak generation. All you had to do is copy the repository url and clone inside the IDE.

## Capabilities
- Differentiate and integrate almost any kind of expression with its SymPy backend
- See the result thorugh a nice looking figure generated by matplotlib
- Also see some graphs of the input and output expressions with some basic customization like:
  - Define the ranges
  - Alter the individual color of the lines of the subplots
